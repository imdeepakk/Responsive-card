# Responsive Profile Card UI

This is a simple and responsive **Profile Card UI** that showcases a clean and modern design, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It’s perfect for beginners looking to practice **front-end development** and **responsive design**.

## Features:
- A circular profile image at the top with a background.
- Links to social media profiles like **LinkedIn**, **Instagram**, **GitHub**, and **Twitter**.
- Two action buttons: **Let's Talk** and **Follow**.
- Social media buttons styled using **Boxicons**.
- A responsive design that looks great on all devices.

## How It Works:
1. The **profile image** is placed inside a circular container with a background.
2. The **social media links** are embedded as icons inside rounded buttons.
3. **CSS** is used to style the entire card, including hover effects and layout responsiveness.

This project helped me enhance my understanding of **HTML** and **CSS** fundamentals. It’s a great project to get started with and can be customized to create personal profiles or portfolios.
